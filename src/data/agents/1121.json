Coupled with his Thiren traits (better adaptation to Hollow environments than humans, faster mutation rate after exposure to corruption, but also rapid recovery), he is deemed highly suitable for long-term work within Hollows.",
    "ProfileDesc": "Ben is the financial and asset management director at Belobog Heavy Industries and one of Koleda's trusted aides.\n\"I enjoy mathematics, but that doesn't stop me from giving thugs a good smack.\"\nHe's a burly and strong Thiren. Despite his tough exterior, he's of a surprisingly sensitive and detail-oriented nature, especially when it comes to numbers.\nOriginally a frontline mechanical operator at Belobog, his talents caught Koleda's discerning eye, leading to his promotion to a managerial position responsible for the company's finances.\nGrateful for Koleda's trust in him, he remains profoundly loyal to her.\nHis favorite food is black caviar, but he dislikes fish.\n\nI once witnessed this imposing figure seated in a small office chair, wearing small glasses, and carefully cross-referencing Belobog's asset records while mashing away at a calculator with his huge fingers.\nQuestion: Is that what they call on Inter-Knot a \"Kawaii Curveball?\"",
